# Data Analysis on IT-Salaries

This project analyzes salary data from a CSV file using various Python libraries, including `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. It performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights related to salary distribution across different job titles, companies, and locations.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `ds_salaries.csv`, which contains information about salary data, job titles, company locations, work years, and other attributes. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and check for missing values.
   - Examine the data types and shape.

2. **Salary Analysis**
   - Group the data by different categories like job title, company location, and employee residence.
   - Visualize the highest and lowest salaries within these categories.

3. **Work Year and Job Title Analysis**
   - Analyze the trends in salary over different years.
   - Examine the distribution of job titles over the years.

4. **Experience Level and Employment Type**
   - Group by experience level and employment type to analyze the impact on salary.

5. **Company Location Analysis**
   - Focus on salaries across different company locations and visualize the results.

6. **Salary Conversion**
   - Convert salary values based on currency exchange rates.

7. **Plotting and Visualizations**
   - Multiple bar plots and pie charts are used to visualize the data in a meaningful way.

## Output Visualizations

Several bar plots and pie charts are generated for visual representation of the data:
- Salary by Job Title
- Salary by Company Location
- Salary by Work Year
- Salary by Experience Level
- Salary by Employment Type
